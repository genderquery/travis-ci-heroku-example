				"                       Version 3, 19 November 2007\n" +
				"\n" +
				" Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <https://fsf.org/>\n" +
				" Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies\n" +
				" of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.\n" +
				"\n" +
				"                            Preamble\n" +
				"\n" +
				"  The GNU Affero General Public License is a free, copyleft license for\n" +
				"software and other kinds of works, specifically designed to ensure\n" +
				"cooperation with the community in the case of network server software.\n" +
				"\n" +
				"  The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed\n" +
				"to take away your freedom to share and change the works.  By contrast,\n" +
				"our General Public Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to\n" +
				"share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free\n" +
				"software for all its users.\n" +
				"\n" +
				"  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not\n" +
				"price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you\n" +
				"have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for\n" +
				"them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you\n" +
				"want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new\n" +
				"free programs, and that you know you can do these things.\n" +
				"\n" +
				"  Developers that use our General Public Licenses protect your rights\n" +
				"with two steps: (1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer\n" +
				"you this License which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute\n" +
				"and/or modify the software.\n" +
				"\n" +
				"  A secondary benefit of defending all users' freedom is that\n" +
				"improvements made in alternate versions of the program, if they\n" +
				"receive widespread use, become available for other developers to\n" +
				"incorporate.  Many developers of free software are heartened and\n" +
				"encouraged by the resulting cooperation.  However, in the case of\n" +
				"software used on network servers, this result may fail to come about.\n" +
				"The GNU General Public License permits making a modified version and\n" +
				"letting the public access it on a server without ever releasing its\n" +
				"source code to the public.\n" +
				"\n" +
				"  The GNU Affero General Public License is designed specifically to\n" +
				"ensure that, in such cases, the modified source code becomes available\n" +
				"to the community.  It requires the operator of a network server to\n" +
				"provide the source code of the modified version running there to the\n" +
				"users of that server.  Therefore, public use of a modified version, on\n" +
				"a publicly accessible server, gives the public access to the source\n" +
				"code of the modified version.\n" +
				"\n" +
				"  An older license, called the Affero General Public License and\n" +
				"published by Affero, was designed to accomplish similar goals.  This is\n" +
				"a different license, not a version of the Affero GPL, but Affero has\n" +
				"released a new version of the Affero GPL which permits relicensing under\n" +
				"this license.\n" +
				"\n" +
				"  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\n" +
				"modification follow.\n" +
				"\n" +
				"                       TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n" +
				"\n" +
				"  0. Definitions.\n" +
				"\n" +
				'  "This License" refers to version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License.\n' +
				"\n" +
				'  "Copyright" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of\n' +
				"works, such as semiconductor masks.\n" +
				"\n" +
				'  "The Program" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this\n' +
				'License.  Each licensee is addressed as "you".  "Licensees" and\n' +
				'"recipients" may be individuals or organizations.\n' +
				"\n" +
				'  To "modify" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work\n' +
				"in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an\n" +
				'exact copy.  The resulting work is called a "modified version" of the\n' +
				'earlier work or a work "based on" the earlier work.\n' +
				"\n" +
				'  A "covered work" means either the unmodified Program or a work based\n' +
				"on the Program.\n" +
				"\n" +
				'  To "propagate" a work means to do anything with it that, without\n' +
				"permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for\n" +
				"infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a\n" +
				"computer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying,\n" +
				"distribution (with or without modification), making available to the\n" +
				"public, and in some countries other activities as well.\n" +
				"\n" +
				'  To "convey" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other\n' +
				"parties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through\n" +
				"a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.\n" +
				"\n" +
				'  An interactive user interface displays "Appropriate Legal Notices"\n' +
				"to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible\n" +
				"feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)\n" +
				"tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the\n" +
				"extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the\n" +
				"work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If\n" +
				"the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a\n" +
				"menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.\n" +
				"\n" +
				"  1. Source Code.\n" +
				"\n" +
				'  The "source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work\n' +
				'for making modifications to it.  "Object code" means any non-source\n' +
				"form of a work.\n" +
				"\n" +
				'  A "Standard Interface" means an interface that either is an official\n' +
				"standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of\n" +
				"interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that\n" +
				"is widely used among developers working in that language.\n" +
				"\n" +
				'  The "System Libraries" of an executable work include anything, other\n' +
				"than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of\n" +
				"packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major\n" +
				"Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that\n" +
				"Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an\n" +
				"implementation is available to the public in source code form.  A\n" +
				'"Major Component", in this context, means a major essential component\n' +
				"(kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system\n" +
				"(if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to\n" +
				"produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.\n" +
				"\n" +
				'  The "Corresponding Source" for a work in object code form means all\n' +
				"the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable\n" +
				"work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to\n" +
				"control those activities.  However, it does not include the work's\n" +
				"System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free\n" +
				"programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but\n" +
				"which are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source\n" +
				"includes interface definition files associated with source files for\n" +
				"the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically\n" +
				"linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,\n" +
				"such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those\n" +
				"subprograms and other parts of the work.\n" +
				"\n" +
				"  The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users\n" +
				"can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding\n" +
				"Source.\n" +
				"\n" +
				"  The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that\n" +
				"same work.\n" +
				"\n" +
				"  2. Basic Permissions.\n" +
				"\n" +
				"  All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of\n" +
				"copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated\n" +
				"conditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited\n" +
				"permission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a\n" +
				"covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its\n" +
				"content, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your\n" +
				"rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.\n" +
				"\n" +
				"  You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not\n" +
				"convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains\n" +
				"in force.  You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose\n" +
				"of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you\n" +
				"with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with\n" +
				"the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do\n" +
				"not control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works\n" +
				"for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction\n" +
				"and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of\n" +
				"your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.\n" +
				"\n" +
				"  Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under\n" +
				"the conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10\n" +
				"makes it unnecessary.\n" +
				"\n" +
				"  3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.\n" +
				"\n" +
				"  No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological\n" +
				"measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article\n" +
				"11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or\n" +
				"similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such\n" +
				"measures.\n" +
				"\n" +
				"  When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid\n" +
				"circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention\n" +
				"is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to\n" +
				"the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or\n" +
				"modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's\n" +
				"users, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of\n" +
				"technological measures.\n" +
				"\n" +
				"  4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.\n" +
				"\n" +
				"  You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you\n" +
				"receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and\n" +
				"appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;\n" +
				"keep intact all notices stating that this License and any\n" +
				"non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;\n" +
				"keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all\n" +
				"recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.\n" +
				"\n" +
				"  You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,\n" +
				"and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.\n" +
				"\n" +
				"  5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.\n" +
				"\n" +
				"  You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to\n" +
				"produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the\n" +
				"terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n" +
				"\n" +
				"    a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified\n" +
				"    it, and giving a relevant date.\n" +
				"\n" +
				"    b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is\n" +
				"    released under this License and any conditions added under section\n" +
				"    7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to\n" +
				'    "keep intact all notices".\n' +
				"\n" +
				"    c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this\n" +
				"    License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This\n" +
				"    License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7\n" +
				"    additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,\n" +
				"    regardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no\n" +
				"    permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not\n" +
				"    invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.\n" +
				"\n" +
				"    d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display\n" +
				"    Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive\n" +
				"    interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your\n" +
				"    work need not make them do so.\n" +
				"\n" +
				"  A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent\n" +
				"works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,\n" +
				"and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,\n" +
				"in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an\n" +
				'"aggregate" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not\n' +
				"used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users\n" +
				"beyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work\n" +
				"in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other\n" +
				"parts of the aggregate.\n" +
				"\n" +
				"  6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.\n" +
				"\n" +
				"  You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms\n" +
				"of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the\n" +
				"machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,\n" +
				"in one of these ways:\n" +
				"\n" +
				"    a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product\n" +
				"    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the\n" +
				"    Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium\n" +
				"    customarily used for software interchange.\n" +
				"\n" +
				"    b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product\n" +
				"    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a\n" +
				"    written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as\n" +
				"    long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product\n" +
				"    model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a\n" +
				"    copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the\n" +
				"    product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical\n" +
				"    medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no\n" +
				"    more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this\n" +
				"    conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the\n" +
				"    Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.\n" +
				"\n" +
				"    c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the\n" +
				"    written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This\n" +
				"    alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and\n" +
				"    only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord\n" +
				"    with subsection 6b.\n" +
				"\n" +
				"    d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated\n" +
				"    place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the\n" +
				"    Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no\n" +
				"    further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the\n" +
				"    Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to\n" +
				"    copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source\n" +
				"    may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)\n" +
				"    that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain\n" +
				"    clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the\n" +
				"    Corresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the\n" +
				"    Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is\n" +
				"    available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.\n" +
				"\n" +
				"    e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided\n" +
				"    you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding\n" +
				"    Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no\n" +
				"    charge under subsection 6d.\n" +
				"\n" +
				"  A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded\n" +
				"from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be\n" +
				"included in conveying the object code work.\n" +
				"\n" +
				'  A "User Product" is either (1) a "consumer product", which means any\n' +
				"tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,\n" +
				"or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation\n" +
				"into a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a consumer product,\n" +
				"doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.  For a particular\n" +
				'product received by a particular user, "normally used" refers to a\n' +
				"typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status\n" +
				"of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user\n" +
				"actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.  A product\n" +
				"is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial\n" +
				"commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent\n" +
				"the only significant mode of use of the product.\n" +
				"\n" +
				'  "Installation Information" for a User Product means any methods,\n' +
				"procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install\n" +
				"and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from\n" +
				"a modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The information must\n" +
				"suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object\n" +
				"code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because\n" +
				"modification has been made.\n" +
				"\n" +
				"  If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or\n" +
				"specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as\n" +
				"part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the\n" +
				"User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a\n" +
				"fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the\n" +
				"Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied\n" +
				"by the Installation Information.  But this requirement does not apply\n" +
				"if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install\n" +
				"modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has\n" +
				"been installed in ROM).\n" +
				"\n" +
				"  The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a\n" +
				"requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates\n" +
				"for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for\n" +
				"the User Product in which it has been modified or installed.  Access to a\n" +
				"network may be denied when the modification itself materially and\n" +
				"adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and\n" +
				"protocols for communication across the network.\n" +
				"\n" +
				"  Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,\n" +
				"in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly\n" +
				"documented (and with an implementation available to the public in\n" +
				"source code form), and must require no special password or key for\n" +
				"unpacking, reading or copying.\n" +
				"\n" +
				"  7. Additional Terms.\n" +
				"\n" +
				'  "Additional permissions" are terms that supplement the terms of this\n' +
				"License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.\n" +
				"Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall\n" +
				"be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent\n" +
				"that they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions\n" +
				"apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately\n" +
				"under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by\n" +
				"this License without regard to the additional permissions.\n" +
				"\n" +
				"  When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option\n" +
				"remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of\n" +
				"it.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own\n" +
				"removal in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place\n" +
				"additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,\n" +
				"for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.\n" +
				"\n" +
				"  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you\n" +
				"add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of\n" +
				"that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:\n" +
				"\n" +
				"    a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the\n" +
				"    terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or\n" +
				"\n" +
				"    b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or\n" +
				"    author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal\n" +
				"    Notices displayed by works containing it; or\n" +
				"\n" +
				"    c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or\n" +
				"    requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in\n" +
				"    reasonable ways as different from the original version; or\n" +
				"\n" +
				"    d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or\n" +
				"    authors of the material; or\n" +
				"\n" +
				"    e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some\n" +
				"    trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or\n" +
				"\n" +
				"    f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that\n" +
				"    material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of\n" +
				"    it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for\n" +
				"    any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on\n" +
				"    those licensors and authors.\n" +
				"\n" +
				'  All other non-permissive additional terms are considered "further\n' +
				'restrictions" within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you\n' +
				"received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is\n" +
				"governed by this License along with a term that is a further\n" +
				"restriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document contains\n" +
				"a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this\n" +
				"License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms\n" +
				"of that license document, provided that the further restriction does\n" +
				"not survive such relicensing or conveying.\n" +
				"\n" +
				"  If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you\n" +
				"must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the\n" +
				"additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating\n" +
				"where to find the applicable terms.\n" +
				"\n" +
				"  Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the\n" +
				"form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;\n" +
				"the above requirements apply either way.\n" +
				"\n" +
				"  8. Termination.\n" +
				"\n" +
				"  You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly\n" +
				"provided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or\n" +
				"modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under\n" +
				"this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third\n" +
				"paragraph of section 11).\n" +
				"\n" +
				"  However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your\n" +
				"license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)\n" +
				"provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and\n" +
				"finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright\n" +
				"holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means\n" +
				"prior to 60 days after the cessation.\n" +
				"\n" +
				"  Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is\n" +
				"reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the\n" +
				"violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have\n" +
				"received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that\n" +
				"copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after\n" +
				"your receipt of the notice.\n" +
				"\n" +
				"  Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the\n" +
				"licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under\n" +
				"this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently\n" +
				"reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same\n" +
				"material under section 10.\n" +
				"\n" +
				"  9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.\n" +
				"\n" +
				"  You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or\n" +
				"run a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work\n" +
				"occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission\n" +
				"to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However,\n" +
				"nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or\n" +
				"modify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do\n" +
				"not accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a\n" +
				"covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.\n" +
				"\n" +
				"  10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.\n" +
				"\n" +
				"  Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically\n" +

				"partial invalidity or ineffectiveness shall not invalidate the remainder\n" +
				"of the License, and in such case Affirmer hereby affirms that he or she\n" +

				"  of the Contribution causes such combination to be covered by the\n" +

				"3. REQUIREMENTS\n" +

				"\n" +
				"  a) the Program must also be made available as Source Code, in\n" +
				"  accordance with section 3.2, and the Contributor must accompany\n" +
				"  the Program with a statement that the Source Code for the Program\n" +
				"  is available under this Agreement, and informs Recipients how to\n" +
				"  obtain it in a reasonable manner on or through a medium customarily\n" +
				"  used for software exchange; and\n" +
				"\n" +
				"  b) the Contributor may Distribute the Program under a license\n" +
				"  different than this Agreement, provided that such license:\n" +
				"     i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all other Contributors all\n" +
				"     warranties and conditions, express and implied, including\n" +
				"     warranties or conditions of title and non-infringement, and\n" +
				"     implied warranties or conditions of merchantability and fitness\n" +
				"     for a particular purpose;\n" +
				"\n" +
				"     ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all other Contributors all\n" +
				"     liability for damages, including direct, indirect, special,\n" +
				"     incidental and consequential damages, such as lost profits;\n" +
				"\n" +
				"     iii) does not attempt to limit or alter the recipients' rights\n" +
				"     in the Source Code under section 3.2; and\n" +
				"\n" +
				"     iv) requires any subsequent distribution of the Program by any\n" +
				"     party to be under a license that satisfies the requirements\n" +
				"     of this section 3.\n" +
				"\n" +
				"3.2 When the Program is Distributed as Source Code:\n" +
				"\n" +
				"  a) it must be made available under this Agreement, or if the\n" +
				"  Program (i) is combined with other material in a separate file or\n" +
				"  files made available under a Secondary License, and (ii) the initial\n" +
				"  Contributor attached to the Source Code the notice described in\n" +
				"  Exhibit A of this Agreement, then the Program may be made available\n" +
				"  under the terms of such Secondary Licenses, and\n" +
				"\n" +
				"  b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of\n" +
				"  the Program.\n" +

				"4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION\n" +
				"\n" +
				"Commercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities\n" +
				"with respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this\n" +
				"license is intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program,\n" +
				"the Contributor who includes the Program in a commercial product\n" +
				"offering should do so in a manner which does not create potential\n" +
				"liability for other Contributors. Therefore, if a Contributor includes\n" +
				"the Program in a commercial product offering, such Contributor\n" +
				'("Commercial Contributor") hereby agrees to defend and indemnify every\n' +
				'other Contributor ("Indemnified Contributor") against any losses,\n' +
				'damages and costs (collectively "Losses") arising from claims, lawsuits\n' +
				"and other legal actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified\n" +
				"Contributor to the extent caused by the acts or omissions of such\n" +
				"Commercial Contributor in connection with its distribution of the Program\n" +
				"in a commercial product offering. The obligations in this section do not\n" +
				"apply to any claims or Losses relating to any actual or alleged\n" +
				"intellectual property infringement. In order to qualify, an Indemnified\n" +
				"Contributor must: a) promptly notify the Commercial Contributor in\n" +

				"Contributor. If that Commercial Contributor then makes performance\n" +
				"claims, or offers warranties related to Product X, those performance\n" +

				"claims and warranties, and if a court requires any other Contributor to\n" +

				"License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free\n" +
				"software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This\n" +
				"General Public License applies to most of the Free Software\n" +
				"Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to\n" +
				"using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by\n" +
				"the GNU Lesser General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to\n" +
				"your programs, too.\n" +
				"\n" +
				"  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not\n" +
				"price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you\n" +
				"have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for\n" +
				"this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it\n" +
				"if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it\n" +
				"in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.\n" +
				"\n" +
				"  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid\n" +
				"anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.\n" +
				"These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you\n" +
				"distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.\n" +
				"\n" +
				"  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether\n" +
				"gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that\n" +
				"you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the\n" +
				"source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their\n" +
				"rights.\n" +
				"\n" +
				"  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and\n" +
				"(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,\n" +
				"distribute and/or modify the software.\n" +
				"\n" +
				"  Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain\n" +
				"that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free\n" +
				"software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we\n" +
				"want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so\n" +
				"that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original\n" +
				"authors' reputations.\n" +
				"\n" +
				"  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software\n" +
				"patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free\n" +
				"program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the\n" +
				"program proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any\n" +
				"patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.\n" +
				"\n" +
				"  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\n" +
				"modification follow.\n" +
				"\n" +

				"   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\n" +
				"\n" +
				"  0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains\n" +
				"a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed\n" +
				'under the terms of this General Public License.  The "Program", below,\n' +
				'refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program"\n' +
				"means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:\n" +
				"that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,\n" +
				"either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another\n" +
				"language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in\n" +
				'the term "modification".)  Each licensee is addressed as "you".\n' +
				"\n" +
				"Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not\n" +
				"covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of\n" +
				"running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program\n" +
				"is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the\n" +
				"Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).\n" +
				"Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.\n" +
				"\n" +
				"  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's\n" +
				"source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you\n" +
				"conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate\n" +
				"copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the\n" +
				"notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;\n" +
				"and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License\n" +
				"along with the Program.\n" +
				"\n" +
				"You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and\n" +
				"you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.\n" +
				"\n" +
				"  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion\n" +
				"of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and\n" +
				"distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1\n" +
				"above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n" +
				"\n" +
				"    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices\n" +
				"    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.\n" +
				"\n" +
				"    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in\n" +
				"    whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any\n" +
				"    part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third\n" +
				"    parties under the terms of this License.\n" +
				"\n" +
				"    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively\n" +
				"    when run, you must cause it, when started running for such\n" +
				"    interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an\n" +
				"    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a\n" +
				"    notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide\n" +
				"    a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under\n" +
				"    these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this\n" +
				"    License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but\n" +
				"    does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on\n" +
				"    the Program is not required to print an announcement.)\n" +
				"\n" +
				"These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If\n" +
				"identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,\n" +
				"and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in\n" +
				"themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those\n" +
				"sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you\n" +
				"distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based\n" +
				"on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of\n" +
				"this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the\n" +
				"entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.\n" +
				"\n" +
				"Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest\n" +
				"your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to\n" +
				"exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or\n" +
				"collective works based on the Program.\n" +
				"\n" +
				"In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program\n" +
				"with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of\n" +
				"a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under\n" +
				"the scope of this License.\n" +
				"\n" +
				"  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,\n" +
				"under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of\n" +
				"Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:\n" +
				"\n" +
				"    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable\n" +
				"    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections\n" +
				"    1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,\n" +
				"\n" +
				"    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three\n" +
				"    years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your\n" +
				"    cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete\n" +
				"    machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be\n" +
				"    distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium\n" +
				"    customarily used for software interchange; or,\n" +
				"\n" +
				"    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer\n" +
				"    to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is\n" +
				"    allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you\n" +
				"    received the program in object code or executable form with such\n" +
				"    an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)\n" +
				"\n" +
				"The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for\n" +
				"making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source\n" +
				"code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any\n" +
				"associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to\n" +
				"control compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a\n" +
				"special exception, the source code distributed need not include\n" +
				"anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary\n" +
				"form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the\n" +
				"operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component\n" +
				"itself accompanies the executable.\n" +
				"\n" +
				"If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering\n" +
				"access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent\n" +
				"access to copy the source code from the same place counts as\n" +
				"distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not\n" +
				"compelled to copy the source along with the object code.\n" +
				"\n" +
				"  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program\n" +
				"except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt\n" +
				"otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is\n" +
				"void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.\n" +
				"However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under\n" +
				"this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such\n" +
				"parties remain in full compliance.\n" +
				"\n" +
				"  5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not\n" +
				"signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or\n" +
				"distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are\n" +
				"prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by\n" +
				"modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the\n" +
				"Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and\n" +
				"all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying\n" +
				"the Program or works based on it.\n" +
				"\n" +
				"  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the\n" +
				"Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the\n" +
				"original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to\n" +
				"these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further\n" +
				"restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.\n" +
				"You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to\n" +
				"this License.\n" +
				"\n" +
				"  7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent\n" +
				"infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),\n" +
				"conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\n" +
				"otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\n" +
				"excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot\n" +
				"distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\n" +
				"License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you\n" +
				"may not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent\n" +
				"license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by\n" +
				"all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then\n" +
				"the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to\n" +
				"refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.\n" +
				"\n" +
				"If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under\n" +
				"any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to\n" +
				"apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other\n" +
				"circumstances.\n" +
				"\n" +
				"It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any\n" +
				"patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any\n" +
				"such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the\n" +
				"integrity of the free software distribution system, which is\n" +
				"implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made\n" +
				"generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed\n" +
				"through that system in reliance on consistent application of that\n" +
				"system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing\n" +
				"to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot\n" +
				"impose that choice.\n" +
				"\n" +
				"This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to\n" +
				"be a consequence of the rest of this License.\n" +
				"\n" +
				"  8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in\n" +
				"certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the\n" +
				"original copyright holder who places the Program under this License\n" +
				"may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding\n" +
				"those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among\n" +
				"countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates\n" +
				"the limitation as if written in the body of this License.\n" +
				"\n" +
				"  9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions\n" +
				"of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will\n" +
				"be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to\n" +
				"address new problems or concerns.\n" +
				"\n" +
				"Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program\n" +
				'specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any\n' +
				'later version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions\n' +
				"either of that version or of any later version published by the Free\n" +
				"Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of\n" +
				"this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software\n" +
				"Foundation.\n" +
				"\n" +
				"  10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free\n" +
				"programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author\n" +
				"to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free\n" +
				"Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes\n" +
				"make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals\n" +
				"of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and\n" +
				"of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.\n" +
				"\n" +
				"                            NO WARRANTY\n" +
				"\n" +
				"  11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY\n" +
				"FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN\n" +
				"OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES\n" +
				'PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED\n' +
				"OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF\n" +
				"MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS\n" +
				"TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE\n" +
				"PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,\n" +
				"REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n" +
				"\n" +
				"  12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING\n" +
				"WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR\n" +
				"REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,\n" +
				"INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING\n" +
				"OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED\n" +

				"\n" +
				"  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest\n" +

				"\n" +
				" Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <https://fsf.org/>\n" +
				" Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies\n" +
				" of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.\n" +
				"\n" +
				"                            Preamble\n" +
				"\n" +
				"  The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for\n" +
				"software and other kinds of works.\n" +
				"\n" +
				"  The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed\n" +
				"to take away your freedom to share and change the works.  By contrast,\n" +
				"the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to\n" +
				"share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free\n" +
				"software for all its users.  We, the Free Software Foundation, use the\n" +
				"GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to\n" +
				"any other work released this way by its authors.  You can apply it to\n" +
				"your programs, too.\n" +
				"\n" +
				"  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not\n" +
				"price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you\n" +
				"have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for\n" +
				"them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you\n" +
				"want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new\n" +
				"free programs, and that you know you can do these things.\n" +
				"\n" +
				"  To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you\n" +
				"these rights or asking you to surrender the rights.  Therefore, you have\n" +
				"certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if\n" +
				"you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.\n" +
				"\n" +
				"  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether\n" +
				"gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same\n" +
				"freedoms that you received.  You must make sure that they, too, receive\n" +
				"or can get the source code.  And you must show them these terms so they\n" +
				"know their rights.\n" +
				"\n" +
				"  Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:\n" +
				"(1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License\n" +
				"giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.\n" +
				"\n" +
				"  For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains\n" +
				"that there is no warranty for this free software.  For both users' and\n" +
				"authors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as\n" +
				"changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to\n" +
				"authors of previous versions.\n" +
				"\n" +
				"  Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run\n" +
				"modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer\n" +
				"can do so.  This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of\n" +
				"protecting users' freedom to change the software.  The systematic\n" +
				"pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to\n" +
				"use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.  Therefore, we\n" +
				"have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those\n" +
				"products.  If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we\n" +
				"stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions\n" +
				"of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.\n" +
				"\n" +
				"  Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.\n" +
				"States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of\n" +
				"software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to\n" +
				"avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could\n" +
				"make it effectively proprietary.  To prevent this, the GPL assures that\n" +
				"patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.\n" +
				"\n" +
				"  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\n" +
				"modification follow.\n" +
				"\n" +
				"                       TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n" +
				"\n" +
				"  0. Definitions.\n" +
				"\n" +
				'  "This License" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.\n' +
				"\n" +
				'  "Copyright" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of\n' +
				"works, such as semiconductor masks.\n" +
				"\n" +
				'  "The Program" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this\n' +
				'License.  Each licensee is addressed as "you".  "Licensees" and\n' +
				'"recipients" may be individuals or organizations.\n' +
				"\n" +
				'  To "modify" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work\n' +
				"in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an\n" +
				'exact copy.  The resulting work is called a "modified version" of the\n' +
				'earlier work or a work "based on" the earlier work.\n' +
				"\n" +
				'  A "covered work" means either the unmodified Program or a work based\n' +
				"on the Program.\n" +
				"\n" +
				'  To "propagate" a work means to do anything with it that, without\n' +
				"permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for\n" +
				"infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a\n" +
				"computer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying,\n" +
				"distribution (with or without modification), making available to the\n" +
				"public, and in some countries other activities as well.\n" +
				"\n" +
				'  To "convey" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other\n' +
				"parties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through\n" +
				"a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.\n" +
				"\n" +
				'  An interactive user interface displays "Appropriate Legal Notices"\n' +
				"to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible\n" +
				"feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)\n" +
				"tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the\n" +
				"extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the\n" +
				"work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If\n" +
				"the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a\n" +
				"menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.\n" +
				"\n" +
				"  1. Source Code.\n" +
				"\n" +
				'  The "source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work\n' +
				'for making modifications to it.  "Object code" means any non-source\n' +
				"form of a work.\n" +
				"\n" +
				'  A "Standard Interface" means an interface that either is an official\n' +
				"standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of\n" +
				"interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that\n" +
				"is widely used among developers working in that language.\n" +
				"\n" +
				'  The "System Libraries" of an executable work include anything, other\n' +
				"than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of\n" +
				"packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major\n" +
				"Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that\n" +
				"Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an\n" +
				"implementation is available to the public in source code form.  A\n" +
				'"Major Component", in this context, means a major essential component\n' +
				"(kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system\n" +
				"(if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to\n" +
				"produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.\n" +
				"\n" +
				'  The "Corresponding Source" for a work in object code form means all\n' +
				"the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable\n" +
				"work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to\n" +
				"control those activities.  However, it does not include the work's\n" +
				"System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free\n" +
				"programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but\n" +
				"which are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source\n" +
				"includes interface definition files associated with source files for\n" +
				"the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically\n" +
				"linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,\n" +
				"such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those\n" +
				"subprograms and other parts of the work.\n" +
				"\n" +
				"  The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users\n" +
				"can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding\n" +
				"Source.\n" +
				"\n" +
				"  The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that\n" +
				"same work.\n" +
				"\n" +
				"  2. Basic Permissions.\n" +
				"\n" +
				"  All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of\n" +
				"copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated\n" +
				"conditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited\n" +
				"permission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a\n" +
				"covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its\n" +
				"content, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your\n" +
				"rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.\n" +
				"\n" +
				"  You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not\n" +
				"convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains\n" +
				"in force.  You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose\n" +
				"of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you\n" +
				"with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with\n" +
				"the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do\n" +
				"not control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works\n" +
				"for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction\n" +
				"and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of\n" +
				"your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.\n" +
				"\n" +
				"  Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under\n" +
				"the conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10\n" +
				"makes it unnecessary.\n" +
				"\n" +
				"  3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.\n" +
				"\n" +
				"  No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological\n" +
				"measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article\n" +
				"11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or\n" +
				"similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such\n" +
				"measures.\n" +
				"\n" +
				"  When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid\n" +
				"circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention\n" +
				"is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to\n" +
				"the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or\n" +
				"modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's\n" +
				"users, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of\n" +
				"technological measures.\n" +
				"\n" +
				"  4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.\n" +
				"\n" +
				"  You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you\n" +
				"receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and\n" +
				"appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;\n" +
				"keep intact all notices stating that this License and any\n" +
				"non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;\n" +
				"keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all\n" +
				"recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.\n" +
				"\n" +
				"  You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,\n" +
				"and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.\n" +
				"\n" +
				"  5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.\n" +
				"\n" +
				"  You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to\n" +
				"produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the\n" +
				"terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n" +
				"\n" +
				"    a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified\n" +
				"    it, and giving a relevant date.\n" +
				"\n" +
				"    b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is\n" +
				"    released under this License and any conditions added under section\n" +
				"    7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to\n" +
				'    "keep intact all notices".\n' +
				"\n" +
				"    c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this\n" +
				"    License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This\n" +
				"    License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7\n" +
				"    additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,\n" +
				"    regardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no\n" +
				"    permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not\n" +
				"    invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.\n" +
				"\n" +
				"    d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display\n" +
				"    Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive\n" +
				"    interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your\n" +
				"    work need not make them do so.\n" +
				"\n" +
				"  A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent\n" +
				"works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,\n" +
				"and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,\n" +
				"in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an\n" +
				'"aggregate" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not\n' +
				"used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users\n" +
				"beyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work\n" +
				"in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other\n" +
				"parts of the aggregate.\n" +
				"\n" +
				"  6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.\n" +
				"\n" +
				"  You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms\n" +
				"of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the\n" +
				"machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,\n" +
				"in one of these ways:\n" +
				"\n" +
				"    a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product\n" +
				"    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the\n" +
				"    Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium\n" +
				"    customarily used for software interchange.\n" +
				"\n" +
				"    b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product\n" +
				"    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a\n" +
				"    written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as\n" +
				"    long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product\n" +
				"    model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a\n" +
				"    copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the\n" +
				"    product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical\n" +
				"    medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no\n" +
				"    more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this\n" +
				"    conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the\n" +
				"    Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.\n" +
				"\n" +
				"    c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the\n" +
				"    written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This\n" +
				"    alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and\n" +
				"    only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord\n" +
				"    with subsection 6b.\n" +
				"\n" +
				"    d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated\n" +
				"    place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the\n" +
				"    Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no\n" +
				"    further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the\n" +
				"    Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to\n" +
				"    copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source\n" +
				"    may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)\n" +
				"    that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain\n" +
				"    clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the\n" +
				"    Corresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the\n" +
				"    Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is\n" +
				"    available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.\n" +
				"\n" +
				"    e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided\n" +
				"    you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding\n" +
				"    Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no\n" +
				"    charge under subsection 6d.\n" +
				"\n" +
				"  A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded\n" +
				"from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be\n" +
				"included in conveying the object code work.\n" +
				"\n" +
				'  A "User Product" is either (1) a "consumer product", which means any\n' +
				"tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,\n" +
				"or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation\n" +
				"into a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a consumer product,\n" +
				"doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.  For a particular\n" +
				'product received by a particular user, "normally used" refers to a\n' +
				"typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status\n" +
				"of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user\n" +
				"actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.  A product\n" +
				"is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial\n" +
				"commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent\n" +
				"the only significant mode of use of the product.\n" +
				"\n" +
				'  "Installation Information" for a User Product means any methods,\n' +
				"procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install\n" +
				"and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from\n" +
				"a modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The information must\n" +
				"suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object\n" +
				"code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because\n" +
				"modification has been made.\n" +
				"\n" +
				"  If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or\n" +
				"specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as\n" +
				"part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the\n" +
				"User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a\n" +
				"fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the\n" +
				"Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied\n" +
				"by the Installation Information.  But this requirement does not apply\n" +
				"if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install\n" +
				"modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has\n" +
				"been installed in ROM).\n" +
				"\n" +
				"  The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a\n" +
				"requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates\n" +
				"for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for\n" +
				"the User Product in which it has been modified or installed.  Access to a\n" +
				"network may be denied when the modification itself materially and\n" +
				"adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and\n" +
				"protocols for communication across the network.\n" +
				"\n" +
				"  Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,\n" +
				"in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly\n" +
				"documented (and with an implementation available to the public in\n" +
				"source code form), and must require no special password or key for\n" +
				"unpacking, reading or copying.\n" +
				"\n" +
				"  7. Additional Terms.\n" +
				"\n" +
				'  "Additional permissions" are terms that supplement the terms of this\n' +
				"License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.\n" +
				"Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall\n" +
				"be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent\n" +
				"that they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions\n" +
				"apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately\n" +
				"under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by\n" +
				"this License without regard to the additional permissions.\n" +
				"\n" +
				"  When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option\n" +
				"remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of\n" +
				"it.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own\n" +
				"removal in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place\n" +
				"additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,\n" +
				"for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.\n" +
				"\n" +
				"  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you\n" +
				"add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of\n" +
				"that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:\n" +
				"\n" +
				"    a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the\n" +
				"    terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or\n" +
				"\n" +
				"    b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or\n" +
				"    author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal\n" +
				"    Notices displayed by works containing it; or\n" +
				"\n" +
				"    c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or\n" +
				"    requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in\n" +
				"    reasonable ways as different from the original version; or\n" +
				"\n" +
				"    d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or\n" +
				"    authors of the material; or\n" +
				"\n" +
				"    e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some\n" +
				"    trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or\n" +
				"\n" +
				"    f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that\n" +
				"    material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of\n" +
				"    it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for\n" +
				"    any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on\n" +
				"    those licensors and authors.\n" +
				"\n" +
				'  All other non-permissive additional terms are considered "further\n' +
				'restrictions" within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you\n' +
				"received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is\n" +
				"governed by this License along with a term that is a further\n" +
				"restriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document contains\n" +
				"a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this\n" +
				"License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms\n" +
				"of that license document, provided that the further restriction does\n" +

				"\n" +
				"  However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your\n" +

				"                            Preamble\n" +
				"\n" +
				"  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your\n" +
				"freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public\n" +
				"Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change\n" +
				"free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.\n" +
				"\n" +
				"  This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some\n" +
				"specially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the\n" +
				"Free Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it.  You\n" +
				"can use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether\n" +
				"this license or the ordinary General Public License is the better\n" +
				"strategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations below.\n" +
				"\n" +
				"  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use,\n" +
				"not price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that\n" +
				"you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge\n" +
				"for this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get\n" +
				"it if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of\n" +
				"it in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do\n" +
				"these things.\n" +
				"\n" +
				"  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid\n" +
				"distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these\n" +
				"rights.  These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for\n" +
				"you if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.\n" +
				"\n" +
				"  For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis\n" +
				"or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave\n" +
				"you.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source\n" +
				"code.  If you link other code with the library, you must provide\n" +
				"complete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them\n" +
				"with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling\n" +
				"it.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.\n" +
				"\n" +
				"  We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the\n" +
				"library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal\n" +
				"permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.\n" +
				"\n" +
				"  To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that\n" +
				"there is no warranty for the free library.  Also, if the library is\n" +
				"modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know\n" +
				"that what they have is not the original version, so that the original\n" +
				"author's reputation will not be affected by problems that might be\n" +
				"introduced by others.\n" +
				"\n" +
				"  Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of\n" +
				"any free program.  We wish to make sure that a company cannot\n" +
				"effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a\n" +
				"restrictive license from a patent holder.  Therefore, we insist that\n" +
				"any patent license obtained for a version of the library must be\n" +
				"consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.\n" +
				"\n" +
				"  Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the\n" +
				"ordinary GNU General Public License.  This license, the GNU Lesser\n" +
				"General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and\n" +
				"is quite different from the ordinary General Public License.  We use\n" +
				"this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those\n" +
				"libraries into non-free programs.\n" +
				"\n" +
				"  When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using\n" +
				"a shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a\n" +
				"combined work, a derivative of the original library.  The ordinary\n" +
				"General Public License therefore permits such linking only if the\n" +
				"entire combination fits its criteria of freedom.  The Lesser General\n" +
				"Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with\n" +
				"the library.\n" +
				"\n" +
				'  We call this license the "Lesser" General Public License because it\n' +
				"does Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General\n" +
				"Public License.  It also provides other free software developers Less\n" +
				"of an advantage over competing non-free programs.  These disadvantages\n" +
				"are the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many\n" +
				"libraries.  However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain\n" +
				"special circumstances.\n" +
				"\n" +
				"  For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to\n" +
				"encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it becomes\n" +
				"a de-facto standard.  To achieve this, non-free programs must be\n" +
				"allowed to use the library.  A more frequent case is that a free\n" +
				"library does the same job as widely used non-free libraries.  In this\n" +
				"case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free\n" +
				"software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.\n" +
				"\n" +
				"  In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free\n" +
				"programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body of\n" +
				"free software.  For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in\n" +
				"non-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU\n" +
				"operating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating\n" +
				"system.\n" +
				"\n" +
				"  Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the\n" +
				"users' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is\n" +
				"linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run\n" +
				"that program using a modified version of the Library.\n" +
				"\n" +
				"  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\n" +
				"modification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a\n" +
				'"work based on the library" and a "work that uses the library".  The\n' +
				"former contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must\n" +
				"be combined with the library in order to run.\n" +

				"    the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility\n" +
				"    is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,\n" +
				"    in the event an application does not supply such function or\n" +
				"    table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of\n" +
				"    its purpose remains meaningful.\n" +
				"\n" +
				"    (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has\n" +
				"    a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the\n" +
				"    application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any\n" +
				"    application-supplied function or table used by this function must\n" +
				"    be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square\n" +
				"    root function must still compute square roots.)\n" +

				"\n" +
				"  If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data\n" +

				"    that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the\n" +
				"    Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application\n" +
				"    to use the modified definitions.)\n" +
				"\n" +
				"    b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the\n" +
				"    Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a\n" +
				"    copy of the library already present on the user's computer system,\n" +
				"    rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2)\n" +
				"    will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if\n" +
				"    the user installs one, as long as the modified version is\n" +
				"    interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with.\n" +
				"\n" +
				"    c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at\n" +
				"    least three years, to give the same user the materials\n" +
				"    specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more\n" +
				"    than the cost of performing this distribution.\n" +

				"\n" +
				'  For an executable, the required form of the "work that uses the\n' +

				"\n" +
				"    a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work\n" +

				"    facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the\n" +
				"    Sections above.\n" +

				"\n" +

				"the Library except as expressly provided under this License.  Any\n" +

				"terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.\n" +
				"\n" +
				"  9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not\n" +
				"signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or\n" +
				"distribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions are\n" +
				"prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by\n" +

				"impose that choice.\n" +
				"\n" +
				"This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to\n" +
				"be a consequence of the rest of this License.\n" +
				"\n" +
				"  12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in\n" +
				"certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the\n" +
				"original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add\n" +
				"an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries,\n" +

				"\n" +
				"All distribution of Covered Software in Source Code Form, including any\n" +

				"the terms of this License. You must inform recipients that the Source\n" +
				"Code Form of the Covered Software is governed by the terms of this\n" +
				"License, and how they can obtain a copy of this License. You may not\n" +
				"attempt to alter or restrict the recipients' rights in the Source Code\n" +
				"Form.\n" +
				"\n" +
				"3.2. Distribution of Executable Form\n" +
				"\n" +
				"If You distribute Covered Software in Executable Form then:\n" +
				"\n" +
				"(a) such Covered Software must also be made available in Source Code\n" +

				"    the Executable Form how they can obtain a copy of such Source Code\n" +
				"    Form by reasonable means in a timely manner, at a charge no more\n" +
				"    than the cost of distribution to the recipient; and\n" +
				"\n" +
				"(b) You may distribute such Executable Form under the terms of this\n" +
				"    License, or sublicense it under different terms, provided that the\n" +
				"    license for the Executable Form does not attempt to limit or alter\n" +
				"    the recipients' rights in the Source Code Form under this License.\n" +
				"\n" +
				"3.3. Distribution of a Larger Work\n" +
				"\n" +
				"You may create and distribute a Larger Work under terms of Your choice,\n" +
				"provided that You also comply with the requirements of this License for\n" +
				"the Covered Software. If the Larger Work is a combination of Covered\n" +
				"Software with a work governed by one or more Secondary Licenses, and the\n" +
				"Covered Software is not Incompatible With Secondary Licenses, this\n" +
				"License permits You to additionally distribute such Covered Software\n" +
				"under the terms of such Secondary License(s), so that the recipient of\n" +
				"the Larger Work may, at their option, further distribute the Covered\n" +
				"Software under the terms of either this License or such Secondary\n" +
				"License(s).\n" +
				"\n" +
				"3.4. Notices\n" +
				"\n" +

				"the extent required to remedy known factual inaccuracies.\n" +
				"\n" +
				"3.5. Application of Additional Terms\n" +
				"\n" +
				"You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support,\n" +
				"indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered\n" +
				"Software. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on\n" +
				"behalf of any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any\n" +
				"such warranty, support, indemnity, or liability obligation is offered by\n" +
				"You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify every Contributor for any\n" +
				"liability incurred by such Contributor as a result of warranty, support,\n" +
				"indemnity or liability terms You offer. You may include additional\n" +
				"disclaimers of warranty and limitations of liability specific to any\n" +
				"jurisdiction.\n" +
				"\n" +
				"4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation\n" +
				"---------------------------------------------------\n" +
				"\n" +
				"If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this\n" +
				"License with respect to some or all of the Covered Software due to\n" +
				"statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with\n" +
				"the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b)\n" +
				"describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description must\n" +
				"be placed in a text file included with all distributions of the Covered\n" +
				"Software under this License. Except to the extent prohibited by statute\n" +
				"or regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed for a\n" +
				"recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.\n" +
				"\n" +
				"5. Termination\n" +
				"--------------\n" +
				"\n" +
				"5.1. The rights granted under this License will terminate automatically\n" +
				"if You fail to comply with any of its terms. However, if You become\n" +
				"compliant, then the rights granted under this License from a particular\n" +
				"Contributor are reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until such\n" +
				"Contributor explicitly and finally terminates Your grants, and (b) on an\n" +
				"ongoing basis, if such Contributor fails to notify You of the\n" +
				"non-compliance by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after You have\n" +
				"come back into compliance. Moreover, Your grants from a particular\n" +
				"Contributor are reinstated on an ongoing basis if such Contributor\n" +
				"notifies You of the non-compliance by some reasonable means, this is the\n" +
				"first time You have received notice of non-compliance with this License\n" +
				"from such Contributor, and You become compliant prior to 30 days after\n" +
				"Your receipt of the notice.\n" +
				"\n" +
				"5.2. If You initiate litigation against any entity by asserting a patent\n" +
				"infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions,\n" +
				"counter-claims, and cross-claims) alleging that a Contributor Version\n" +
				"directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then the rights granted to\n" +
				"You by any and all Contributors for the Covered Software under Section\n" +
				"2.1 of this License shall terminate.\n" +
				"\n" +
				"5.3. In the event of termination under Sections 5.1 or 5.2 above, all\n" +
				"end user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which\n" +
				"have been validly granted by You or Your distributors under this License\n" +
				"prior to termination shall survive termination.\n" +
